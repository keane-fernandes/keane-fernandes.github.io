title: "Software Productivity Tools"

I value software tools that streamline my workflow and help me be more productive. Here are some of my favorites for macOS.

<!--more-->

* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for keyboard based note-taking. Notion supports markdown, typesetting LaTeX formulae and embedding code snippets. I consider Notion to be different from other note taking apps such as OneNote because it is able to 'nest' notes within notes. Nesting helps me hierarchially organise my thoughts and I consider this invaluable.

* [GoodNotes](https://www.goodnotes.com) for stylus based note-taking. GoodNotes has brilliant PDF annotation features and multiplatform support; meaning that your notes sync up across Windows, Android and Apple based operating systems. A feature that's a gamechanger for me, personally, is the ability to search through your handwritten notes using keywords. 

* [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) is a small, free app that lets you move and resize windows into snap areas using keyboard shortcuts. It saves me a lot of time because I no longer constantly switch between windows.
