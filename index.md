# Hello!

I'm Keane, a Software Delivery Engineer at [Jaguar Land Rover](https://automattic.com) on behalf of Alten UK.
I graduated from the University of Bristol in 2021 with a masters in computer science and in 2017 with a masters in engineering.

Before joining Alten UK, I worked at csi GmbH in Germany as a systems engineer, where my work mainly involved simulating battery models and battery management system control algorithms.

If you would like to work together
Contact me at <keanefern@gmail.com>.

When I'm not working, I stream video games that I play on my YouTube channel [NocabHuggies](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNioJ0sOwkLmheuiRnnFjA).
