# Hello!

I'm Keane, a Software Delivery Engineer at [Jaguar Land Rover](https://www.jaguarlandrover.com) on behalf of Alten UK.
I graduated from the University of Bristol in 2021 with a masters in computer science and in 2017 with a masters in engineering.

Before joining Alten UK, I worked at csi GmbH in Germany as a systems engineer, where my work mainly involved simulating battery models and optimising algorithms used in battery management systems.
